Hypothesis Testing: Steps and Concepts

Introduction

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions about a population based on sample data. It involves making an assumption (hypothesis) about a population parameter and then testing this assumption using sample data. The goal is to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

Steps in Hypothesis Testing
1. State the Hypotheses
Null Hypothesis (𝐻0): This is a statement of no effect or no difference. It represents the default or status quo assumption.
Example: There is no significant difference in hiring based on the category (African or Non-African).
'Result': 'Reject the null hypothesis'

Alternative Hypothesis (𝐻1 or 𝐻𝐴): This is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It represents the effect or difference that the test aims to detect.
Example: There is a significant difference in hiring based on the category (African or Non-African).
'Result': 'Fail to reject the null hypothesis'

2. Choose the Significance Level (𝛼)
The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. Common values are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10.
Example: 𝛼=0.05 α=0.05

3. Select the Appropriate Test
The choice of test depends on the type of data and the research question. Some common tests include:
Z-test: Used when the sample size is large (n > 30) and the population variance is known.
T-test: Used when the sample size is small (n ≤ 30) or the population variance is unknown.
Chi-square test: Used for categorical data to test the association between two variables.
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Used to compare means among three or more groups.
Regression analysis: Used to test the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

4. Collect and Summarize the Data
Gather sample data and calculate the appropriate test statistic (e.g., mean, proportion, variance).

5. Calculate the Test Statistic and P-value
The test statistic is a standardized value used to compare the sample data to the null hypothesis.
The P-value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

6. Make a Decision
Compare the P-value to the significance level (𝛼): If P-value ≤ 𝛼, reject the null hypothesis (𝐻0).
If P-value > 𝛼, fail to reject the null hypothesis (𝐻0).

7. Draw a Conclusion
Based on the decision, conclude whether there is sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
